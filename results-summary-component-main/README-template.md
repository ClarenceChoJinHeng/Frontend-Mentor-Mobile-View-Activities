## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;

<!-- Uploading the file using terminal into GitHub -->
Open the terminal and navigate to the root level (first level) of your project folder. Your command will look something like this cd /path/to/my/project-folder. Once there, type git init to initialize Git version control in your project.
Next, add all of your files, so that they‚Äôre ‚Äústaged‚Äù and ready to be committed. You can do this by typing git add . on the command line.
Commit your files with a message by typing git commit -m "Initial commit"
Now we need to make the connection between your locally initialized project and the remote Git repository on GitHub. To do this, copy the command from the repository setup page that looks like this:git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git. Paste it into the command line and hit enter.
Next, push the code to that repository by typing git push -u origin master and hitting enter.
Your code should now be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub. You can double-check this by refreshing the repository page. The setup instructions should disappear and be replaced by your code.
Now that you‚Äôve pushed your code to GitHub using either the manual upload or the Git terminal commands, copy the URL and past it into the Repository URL field on the solution submission form.
